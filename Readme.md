# Shopping Cart Exercise

## Description of the project:

This project demonstrates how to make a call to a Strapi API through restocking functionality.

## How to Run:

Download the files making sure they are in the same folder, they have the same file names and open index.html within a browser. You will also need to start a LocalHost to properly view the html file. Clicking on the "ReStock Products" button will call to the Strapi API and restock the Product List.

## Roadmap of future improvements:

I would like to have the rest of the functionality to work such as the CheckOut portion, overall appearance to be more professional, and the restock to not add more lines of product but to add on to the existing ones i.e. not have multiple rows of apples etc.
